        <h2>Brief</h2>

        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Scootly is a startup founded upon a simple idea: <span class="highlight">what if the environmental benefits of a personal scooter could be combined with the convenience of a rideshare application?</span></p>
          <p>Created in Fall 2022, Scootly’s mobile app assists people in renting their personal scooters out to others in the Los Angeles area. It’s the first app of its kind to promote the more widespread use of a more flexible and eco-friendly transportation option.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h3>Team</h3>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <p>I collaborated with <span class="highlight">1 fellow "dev-signer"</span> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyecho/" class="inline" target="_blank">Jenny</a>) and <span class="highlight">4 developers</span> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnamii" class="inline" target="_blank">John</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwightbumgarner" class="inline" target="_blank">Dwight</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aparna.hrn/" class="inline" target="_blank">Aparna</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhavi-vivek/" class="inline" target="_blank">Madhavi</a>) to bring this project to life.</p>
            <p>The 6 of us were were brought together by a UCLA course: CS 35L, Software Construction Laboratory. Thanks to these guys and their creativity, drive, and entrepreneurship, <span class="highlight">what was originally supposed to just a group project became something much greater!</span></p>

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-building"></i>LA has an urban planning problem.</h4>
            <p>Los Angeles is just one example of a prevailing pattern in the US: <span class="highlight">poor walkability and urban planning</span>. And like many other American cities, LA's public transportation system leaves much to be wanted. This leaves many with no choice but to contribute to an epidemic <span class="highlight">over-reliance on cars, a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions</span>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-wallet"></i>To buy or not to buy?</h4>
            <p>People looking to get around using micromobility vehicles, especially cash-strapped college students, face a dilemma: is it better to purchase your own scooter? Or continously pay for rentals? <span class="highlight">Neither option feels ideal: buying and tending to your own personal scooter seems too much of a hassle; consistently paying for short-term rentals through a company like Bird is way too costly.</span></p>
          </div>

          <div class="callout subsubcontainer">

          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-car-side"></i>Encourage micro-electric mobility.</h4>
            <p>As the threat of climate change looms ever nearer and LA becomes defined increasingly by its notorious traffic, it seems almost natural to kill two birds with one stone. We sought to <span class="highlight">reframe people's perceptions of scooters by positioning them as a viable, easy-to-access form of transportation</span>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"></i>Accommodate all types of scooter-riders.</h4>
            <p>The complications that come with owning a personal scooter are what hold many back from investing in one. With this in mind, we wanted to <span class="highlight">make the idea of owning your own scooter more appealing and worthwhile</span>, but at the same time <span class="highlight">provide a solution to those who want to ride scooters, but aren't able to buy their own</span>.</p>

              <p>Making an app about scooter renting wasn't an instant decision.

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>John, my roommate and soon-to-be-groupmate, once asked our professor if a commercially viable product had ever come out of his class. The answer was no, and from then on, we and the rest of our project team were <span class="highlight">determined to make CS 35L history</span>.</p>

            <p>As of Fall 2023, <span class="highlight">we are still working hard at getting our app published on the iOS App Store!</span> The last steps that stand in the way of our official launch are squishing a few minor bugs and adding a couple of features that Apple requires.</p>

              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-palette"></i>Design doesn't exist in a vacuum.</h4>
              <p>Scootly was originally created as the capstone project for a computer science course known for its difficulty. <span class="highlight">My group recieved a  rare perfect score, while others were marked down for a simple reason: they neglected their UX.</span></p>
              <p>Seeing this helped me realize that design has an implicit effect on all things in life. My love for this field grew even stronger after seeing how its applications are so universal, they reached even to a technical CS class!</p>

            <div class="subsubcontainer">
              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-ruler"></i>Defining a product from scratch isn't easy.</h4>
              <p>Creating a fully functional app within the span of an academic term is an ambitious goal, to say the least. Through Scootly, <span class="highlight">I learned how to adjust the scope of a project (and consequently, its designs) in response to time and development constraints.</span></p>
              <p>In addition, I gained a deeper understanding of the product cycle by continually ensuring that we were working toward a reasonable goal and staying on track to provide a quality delivery.</p>
