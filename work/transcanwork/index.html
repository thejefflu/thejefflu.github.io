            <p><span class="highlight">The method TCW used for keeping track of a jobseeker's progress was a cumbersome, multi-page Google Sheets document.</span> For navigators (professionals assigned to jobseekers to guide them along their journey), repeating this workflow for many different clients was tedious and susceptible to human error. For jobseekers, the process was not very interactive or transparent—<span class="highlight">jobseekers had no way to even see their own progress, contributing to higher rates of burnout and even quitting!</span></p>

              <p>In order to <span class="highlight">maintain jobseeker engagement and motivation</span> in what can be a demoralizing process, our main goal was to make the external-facing app for clients as fun and visually striking as possible.</p>

            <div class="subsubcontainer">

            <div class="subsubcontainer">
              <p>To kick off our research, we <span class="highlight">conducted an analysis of three websites which offer services similar to that of TCW’s</span>: <a href="https://www.jibberjobber.com/login.php"  class="inline" target="_blank">JibberJobber</a>, <a href="https://www.ajcc.lacounty.gov/job-seekers/population-specific-placement-services/youth-work-ages-14-24"  class="inline" target="_blank">Youth@Work</a>, and <a href="https://www.jobsearchjourney.com"  class="inline" target="_blank">Job Search Journey</a>. We were then able to identify commonalities between the sites which suggested features we should incorporate in our own product, as well as things we noticed that we'd want to avoid doing.</p>

            <p class="subsubcontainer">Next, my team and I interviewed several TransCanWork employees to better understand the issues they were facing. <span class="highlight">Our conversations confirmed from firsthand sources that TCW’s process took a great deal of agency out of jobseekers' hands</span>, while simultaneously forcing lots of manual work and organization onto navigators.</p>

            <div class="columns">
              <div class="subsubcontainer">
                <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-question"></i>Jobseekers felt removed from their own job-searching process.</h4>
                <p>During our inquiries with TCW navigators, we found out that jobseekers only get to meet with their navigators once every 2 weeks, at most. <span class="highlight">Between sessions, jobseekers had no way of accessing the information on their own progress that navigators were seeing.</span> To make matters worse, they lacked easy communication with their navigators, leading to an uninteractive and isolating experience.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="subsubcontainer">
                <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-user-group"></i>TCW’s systems were unequipped to handle large numbers of clients.</h4>
                <p>While TCW’s spreadsheets were the very backbone of their work, they also contributed to a slow, tedious workflow since each jobseeker had their own individual spreadsheet. Our research revealed that <span class="highlight">navigators could expect to have upwards of 100 clients at a time. Having no compartmentalized way to represent all this data was slowing down the process for everyone involved.</span></p>

              <h3>User Flow</h3>
              <p class="subsubcontainer">My team began the design process by mapping out a simple user flow based on the three kinds of TCW users: administrators, navigators, and jobseekers (my main population of interest for this project). This grounded us with <span class="highlight">a home base from which we could ideate possible solutions that worked to the benefit of all types of TCW members</span>.</p>

              <div class="subsubcontainer">
                <p>At this stage, in collaboration with the lovely folks over at TCW who acted as our liasions, <span class="highlight">we made the decision to represent jobseeker milestones in the form of a pirate roadmap! We felt that doing so would help facilitate a motivational sense of progression towards a goal, while also giving the platform an engaging and never-before-seen spin.</span> The theme was inspired by Our Flag Means Death, a rom-com about LGBTQ pirates that had just come out (no pun intended).</p>
                <p>From this point on, I assumed full ownership over this portion of the project. I began by creating a rudimentary sketch, giving each island its own unique, alliterative name for that extra charm factor!</p>

              <h3>Iterative Wireframes</h3>
              <p class="subsubcontainer">Moving onto mid-fidelity designs, my first order of business was to replace the blobs with actual islands! <span class="highlight">Each of the 10 islands represents a section of the TCW's old spreadsheet for mangaing jobseekers, but in a reimagined and user-friendly way.</span> Since this would be an external interface, my main goal during this phase was to create a unique visual theme and alliterative name for each island.</p>
              <img src="iteration1.png" class="subsubcontainer diagram">

              <p class="subsubcontainer">Fast forward several more iterations (although I wish I could show you the whole process!)—the next major update came after showing some preliminary designs to TCW. <span class="highlight">Per TCW's feedback, I adjusted the roadmap details popup to align more with their brand, and modified the data within them to reflect their new data models</span>. I also continuously built upon the roadmap's visual design to give jobseekers the most fun experience possible!</p>

            <div class="subcontainer">
              <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
              <p class="subsubcontainer">At this point, the app was ready for testing with some real users. My team and I <span class="highlight">recruited a mix of jobseekers and navigators, with different levels of experience with TCW, to try out the new roadmap.</span> A session would consist of a series of scenario-based tasks, follow-up questions and feedback, and a questionnaire to help quantify the success of the design.</p>

                <p>The Menu button on the top-left, which served solely as an alternative way of navigating between islands, was only complicating things without providing any additional accessibility. After some discussion, my team and I opted to <span class="highlight">replace the extraneous menu with a calendar of TCW events, to give convenient access to a common resource and help reduce cognitive load</span>.</p>

            <p>As popularly requested during our user testing, jobseekers can also access their roadmaps from the convenience of their phones!

This way, we provide a flexible and joyful experience on the go.</p>

            <p class="subsubcontainer">For a project of this scale, it was crucial to create an organized style guide that would ensure consistent design and implementation. <span class="highlight">Playful fonts and full color palettes were individually chosen for each island</span> to create the most engaging and nautical experience possible.

                <p>When I was first entering the design industry, I never imagined I’d one day be creating a pirate map for job-hunting. This project, with all its flashy colors and illustrations, was much different from the minimalistic designs I was used to. </p>
                <p>However, doing something a bit outside of my design comfort zone was incredibly refreshing and eye-opening. Not only did I get to create a gamified client interface—a rare opportunity in and of itself—in the process, <span class="highlight">I was introduced an entire world of design trends and styles that I had yet to previously delve into. Now that I've gotten a taste, I've found myself much more willing to experiment and take risks in my design work!</span></p>

              <div class="subsubcontainer">
                <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-shapes"></i>Keep an organized design file.</h4>
                <p>This project helped me realize that <span class="highlight">in many ways, design is more about working smart than working hard (although I'd like to think I am doing both!) This manifested itself in my work with TCW when I decided to componentize everything I could, from input fields to decorational shipwrecks. Doing so ended up saving me hours of time, allowing for a more quality end result.</span></p>
                <p>My only regret is that I wish I’d started sooner—I only bit the bullet and componentized all of my work around the third iteration—but now I know what to do for whatever project I take on next!</p>

And a big thank you to the TransCanWork team</span> for holding the most wonderfully chaotic work sessions, for implementing all the crazy designs I came up with without a complaint, and for always being up for a discussion about whether Helen Keller really flew a plane.</p>
