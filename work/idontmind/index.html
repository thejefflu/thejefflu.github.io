              <p>We included an <span class="highlight">interactive explanation of the app's overarching goal</span> (support when you need it, independence when you're ready) as part of the onboarding process after account creation.

              <p>We <span class="highlight">randomized and shuffled the prompts</span> shown in each check-in, with the exception of three core questions (determined by our expert therapist consultants) which target mood, sleep, and energy. To <span class="highlight">minimize any pressure and expectations that might induce additional stress</span>, we also provided an option to skip a day's check-in and come back to it later.</p>

              <p class="subheading">How might we display IDONTMIND's vast library of content?</p>
              <p>We worked with IDONTMIND to file all content under one or more relevant tags (e.g. Burnout, Meditation, Anxiety). For easy discovery, we provided users with the ability to <span class="highlight">search, filter, and browse content by tag</span>. These tools <span class="highlight">combine the convenience of IDONTMIND's Instagram with the depth of their website</span> for a best-of-both-worlds platform.</p>

                <p>Once we had a working prototype of the app up and running, we shared it with 6 users to gather their thoughts and see where we had room for improvement.</p>
                <p>While scriptwriting, we made sure to keep our original design goals in mind. For example, <span class="highlight">5/6 participants indicated that the app's intention of guiding its users towards outgrowing the app was made clear</span>, which was reassuring for us!</p>
                <p>More importantly, however, we received some invaluable feedback regarding the usability of the app that we'd then iterate upon.</p>

              <p>The first thing a user will see upon opening the app is a welcome screen leading to the check-in.

              <p class="subheading">Solution</p>
              <p>We remedied this with some explanatory copy, <span class="highlight">written with the intention of reducing pressure to complete the check-in immediately</span>. Although this was a simple change, it got us thinking about other ways we could make the splash screen more welcoming and less repetitive. We created copy and graphics that would greet the user and change throughout the day, to <span class="highlight">guide the tone of the app more towards the friendly vibe we were aiming for</span>!</p>

              <p class="subheading">Solution</p>
              <p>I encouraged my designer who'd made this screen to <span class="highlight">explore different ways of displaying content that wouldn't require as much vertical scrolling</span>, so that users could browse content with greater ease. We also explored ways to visually reinforce the hierarchical distinction between content tags and "supertags," which grouped the app's 100+ tags into 9 categories for easier navigation.</p>

              <p class="subheading">Solution</p>
              <p>To <span class="highlight">allow users to write for the sake of writing</span>, without being forced to pin on the label of a title, we made titling journal entries optional.

              <p>To <span class="highlight">more clearly demarcate interactivity</span>, and to <span class="highlight">address developer constraints that were brought to our attention</span> around the same time, we opted for a descriptive card design that was easier to implement, and would also allow for more flexibility in the kinds of trends shown to the user.</p>

              <p>Every design project I've taken on prior to this has been done—for the most part—solo. I carried this attitude into IDONTMIND, but quickly realized that with a team of designers in front of me, there might be a better way to do things. <span class="highlight">I reached out to some of my designer friends asking how to foster a more collaborative environment and began implementing their advice at future meetings</span>, facilitating group discussions where we could bounce ideas off of each other or iterate on each other's designs. Acting as a mentor in this way for less experienced designers was one of the best parts of this journey, and it's where some of the best parts of the final product came from. I only wish I had started doing it sooner!</p>

              <p>Being the lead design engineer for an end-to-end product came with a lot of responsibility. <span class="highlight">Each decision struck a delicate balance between the needs of my users, the requests of the lovely folks at IDONTMIND, and the constraints I had on the home front with my developers and designers.</span> As challenging as it may have been, being at the head of the direction of this project has been the single most rewarding experience I've had in my design career thus far, and it was a fantastic look into what it takes to be a leader in design!</p>
