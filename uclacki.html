      BRIEF

    <section class="brief">
      <div class="container small">
        <h1>Brief</h1>

          <h6 class="subheading">Background</h6>
          <p class="description">Circle K International (CKI) is the world’s largest collegiate service organization. UCLA’s chapter stands at the forefront of CKI, earning the honor of “Outstanding Total Achievement” at the 2022 District Convention and generating thousands of volunteering hours and charity funds annually.</p>

          <h6 class="subheading">Problem Statement</h6>
          <p class="description">The list of resources available to UCLA CKI members is extremely robust, ranging from service event sign-up sheets to test banks. In addition, the club has an overarching theme every year (this year’s was Animal Crossing). 
<br><br>
            With this in mind, <strong>the organization’s current website lacks ease of access to resources, nor does it convey a strong sense of theme or visual identity</strong>. As a result, members can feel confused or overwhelmed rather than assisted by the club website.</p>

          <h1 class="callout extra-margin">"How might we utililize web design to <strong>increase retention</strong> and <strong>improve member experience</strong> for a collegiate student organization?"</h1>

          <h6 class="subheading">Team and Responsibilities</h6>
          <p class="description">As the organization’s director of technology, I was placed <strong>in command of the website’s end-to-end redesign</strong>, from ideation to launch.<br><br>

            In the process, I <strong>worked in tandem with the organization’s graphics director</strong>, who provided Animal Crossing drawings to be integrated into the design. I also <strong>communicated with the club’s executive board</strong> to ensure that designs aligned with the desired “image” of the organization.</p>

          <h6 class="subheading">Scope and Constraints</h6>
          <p class="description">The scope of the redesign extended to <strong>the club’s entire website</strong>, including a welcome splash page, “about” pages, asset repositories, and more.
<br><br>
            The task was also to be completed in a <strong>short time frame</strong>, starting no earlier than the mid-summer reveal of the new club theme, and finishing no later than the beginning of the new school year in September.
            <br><br>
            Finally, because the website is hosted through Weebly, I was somewhat restricted in the designs I could produce due to <strong>inherent implementation limitations</strong>.</p>

          <h1>Research</h1>
  
            <h6 class="subheading">Competitive Analysis</h6>
            <p>Before attempting to create my own designs, I conducted an audit of the websites of 3 other UCLA service organizations, 1 other Circle K branch, and 1 non-collegiate, LA-based service organization.
<br><br>
              In doing so, I <strong>identified 8 features that made websites for service organizations more effective</strong>, whether as means of recruitment or member retention. I would later take special care capitalizing off of these factors when designing Circle K’s own website.</p>

            <h6 class="subheading">Contextual Inquiry</h6>
            <p>Next, I reached out to <strong>10 current Circle K members</strong> and invited them to participate in written interviews to find out more about the range of their values and experiences. I found that:</p>

            <h6 class="subheading">Takeaways</h6>
            <p>Working on UCLA CKI’s website was my first foray into the art of designing for a “real-world” project, as opposed to a concept. As such, I was able use the opportunity to <strong>streamline a design process</strong> that works best for me, and gained a new appreciation for <strong>the importance of visual identity and pathos-centered design</strong> in the world of marketing. 

              Through the extensive research that the project demanded, I also gained new insight about the importance of <strong>keeping the user front and center</strong> every step of the way, as their needs and thought processes do not always align with what I, as a designer, might expect.</p>
