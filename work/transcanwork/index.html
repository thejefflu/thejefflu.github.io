We were then able to identify commonalities between the sites which suggested features we should incorporate in our own product, as well as things we noticed that we'd want to avoid doing.</br>

To make matters worse, they lacked easy communication with their navigators, leading to an uninteractive and isolating experience.</p>

Our research revealed that navigators could expect to have upwards of 100 clients at a time.

              <p>At this stage, in collaboration with the lovely folks over at TCW who acted as our liasions, we made the decision to represent jobseeker milestones in the form of a pirate roadmap! We felt that doing so would help facilitate a motivational sense of progression towards a goal, while also giving the platform an engaging and never-before-seen spin. The theme was inspired by Our Flag Means Death, a rom-com about LGBTQ pirates that had just come out (no pun intended).</p>
              <p>From this point on, I assumed full ownership over this portion of the project. I began by creating a rudimentary sketch, giving each island its own unique, alliterative name for that extra charm factor!</p>

Since this would be an external interface, my main goal during this phase was to create a unique visual theme and alliterative name for each island.</p>

              <p class="subheading">How might we set users up to use the app with intention?</p>
              <p>We included an <span class="highlight">interactive explanation of the app's overarching goal</span> (support when you need it, independence when you're ready) as part of the onboarding process after account creation. We also sprinkled in <span class="highlight">data-backed research on the benefits of habits encouraged by the app</span> including reflection and sleep hygiene.</p>

            <div class="subcontainer">
              <p class="subheading">How might we prevent check-ins from feeling like a chore?</p>
              <p>We <span class="highlight">randomized and shuffled the prompts</span> shown in each check-in, with the exception of three core questions (determined by our expert therapist consultants) which target mood, sleep, and energy. To <span class="highlight">minimize any pressure and expectations that might induce additional stress</span>, we also provided an option to skip a day's check-in and come back to it later.</p>

            <div class="subcontainer">
              <p class="subheading">How might we display IDONTMIND's vast library of content?</p>
              <p>We worked with IDONTMIND to file all content under one or more relevant tags (e.g. Burnout, Meditation, Anxiety). For easy discovery, we provided users with the ability to <span class="highlight">search, filter, and browse content by tag</span>.

              <p>As popularly requested during our user testing, jobseekers can also access their roadmaps from the convenience of their phones! The roadmap responsively condenses into a linear, scrollable design, intentionally crafted to take full advantage of smaller screens while still providing the feeling of navigating a map. This way, we provide a flexible and joyful experience on the go.</p>

              <p>For a project of this scale, it was crucial to create an organized style guide that would ensure consistent design and implementation. Playful fonts and full color palettes were individually chosen for each island to create the most engaging and nautical experience possible. And it's not just for show: by creating and adhering to this style guide, I expedited my design speed in Figma by an estimated 75%!</p>

                <p>At this point, the app was ready for testing with some real users. My team and I recruited a mix of jobseekers and navigators, with different levels of experience with TCW, to try out the new roadmap. A session would consist of a series of scenario-based tasks, follow-up questions and feedback, and a questionnaire to help quantify the success of the design.</p>

                Design can take many forms.
              </p>
              <p>When I was first entering the design industry, I never imagined I’d one day be creating a pirate map for job-hunting. This project, with all its flashy colors and illustrations, was much different from the minimalistic designs I was used to. However, doing something a bit outside of my design comfort zone was incredibly refreshing and eye-opening. Not only did I get to create a gamified client interface—a rare opportunity in and of itself—in the process, I was introduced an entire world of design trends and styles that I had yet to previously delve into. Now that I've gotten a taste, I've found myself much more willing to experiment and take risks in my design work!</p>

                Keep an organized design file.
              </p>
              <p>This project helped me realize that in many ways, design is more about working smart than working hard (although I'd like to think I am doing both!) This manifested itself in my work with TCW when I decided to componentize everything I could, from input fields to decorational shipwrecks. Doing so ended up saving me hours of time, allowing for a more quality end result. My only regret is that I wish I’d started sooner—I only bit the bullet and componentized all of my work around the third iteration—but now I know what to do for whatever project I take on next!</p>
