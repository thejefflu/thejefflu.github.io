          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>TransCanWork (TCW) is a nonprofit organization that provides job-hunting resources and support for trans, gender-diverse, and intersex (TGI) jobseekers. They also create safer and more comfortable work environments from the ground up by offering training and certification to employers, equipping them with the tools they need to help improve TGI representation in the professional sphere.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h3>Team</h3>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <p>For the creation of this web application, I worked alongside a wonderful team consisting of 1 product manager (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nasser-elhajjaoui-9a00a0213/" class="inline" target="_blank">Nasser</a>), 2 fellow designers (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiyeonhann/" class="inline" target="_blank">Jiyeon</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-tieu/" class="inline" target="_blank">Megan</a>), and 10 developers (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronshi53/" class="inline" target="_blank">Aaron</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-nguyen-ucla/" class="inline" target="_blank">Alan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-hao-5246801b3/" class="inline" target="_blank">Angela</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danxlee/" class="inline" target="_blank">Dan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diya-baliga-7049881ab/" class="inline" target="_blank">Diya</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiamin-xu-9046b7196/" class="inline" target="_blank">Jiamin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayleemtran" class="inline" target="_blank">Kaylee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevantony/" class="inline" target="_blank">Kevin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-yeo-ab5010217/" class="inline" target="_blank">Ryan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/solia-valentine-4961a9228/" class="inline" target="_blank">Solia</a>).</p>

          <h3>Problem</h3>

          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <p>The workflow TCW used for keeping track of next steps for jobseekers was simply a Google Sheets document. For navigators (professionals assigned to jobseekers to guide them along their journey), repeating this process for many different clients was cumbersome and susceptible to human error. For jobseekers, the process was not very interactive or transparent—jobseekers had no way of even seeing their own progress!</p>
            <p>As the organization grew, this manual process became less manageable and desirable for both navigators and jobseekers.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="callout subsubcontainer">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
            <p class="callout-text-large">How might we represent the jobseeking process in a standardized, yet fun and interactive way?</p>
            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
          </div>

          <img src="old-process.png" class="photo subsubcontainer">

        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-gamepad"></i>CREATE A DELIGHTFUL CLIENT-SIDE EXPERIENCE.</h4>
            <p>In order to maintain engagement and motivation in what can be a demoralizing process, we wanted to make the external-facing app for jobseekers as engaging and visually striking as possible.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-wheelchair-move"></i>FOCUS ON ACCESSIBILITY AND EASE-OF-USE.</h4>
            <p>We wanted the website to be an easily navigable and accessible way for jobseekers to track their progress along the jobseeking process. Simultaneously, we also sought to structure content in a way that would make internal management simple for navigators.</p>

          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-half"></i>PRIORITIZE LONG-TERM USABILITY AND UPKEEP.</h4>
            <p>Since TCW doesn’t have any dedicated developers or designers on staff, designing a flexible and thoroughly fleshed out product was critical to ensuring the app’s long-term usefulness.</p>

          <div class="subcontainer">
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

            <div class="subsubcontainer">
              <p>We conducted an analysis of three competitors which offer services similar to that of TCW’s: <a href="https://www.jibberjobber.com/login.php"  class="inline" target="_blank">JibberJobber</a>, <a href="https://www.ajcc.lacounty.gov/job-seekers/population-specific-placement-services/youth-work-ages-14-24"  class="inline" target="_blank">Youth@Work</a>, and <a href="https://www.jobsearchjourney.com"  class="inline" target="_blank">Job Search Journey</a>. We were then able to identify commonalities between the sites which suggested features we should incorporate in our own product, as well as things we noticed that we'd want to avoid doing.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="competitive-analysis.png" class="diagram subsubcontainer">
          </div>

          <div class="subcontainer">
            <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
            <p class="subsubcontainer">Next, my team and I interviewed 2 TransCanWork navigators to better understand the issues they were facing. These conversations confirmed from firsthand sources that TCW’s process was highly manual, and required much individual work and organization from the navigators’ part to keep track of all of TCW’s jobseekers.</p>

            <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
            <p class="subsubcontainer">Lastly, we synthesized our findings from both the competitive audit and the preliminary user interviews to identify common themes and trends. The result was this web of ideas:</p>

              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-user-group"></i>TCW’S SYSTEMS WERE UNEQUIPPED TO HANDLE LARGE NUMBERS OF CLIENTS.</h4>
              <p>While TCW’s spreadsheets were the very backbone of their work, they also contributed to a slow, tedious workflow since each jobseeker had their own individual spreadsheet. Our research revealed that navigators could expect to be responsible for up to 100 jobseekers at a time—imagine the pain of managing 100 spreadsheets full of client info!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="subsubcontainer">
              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-question"></i>JOBSEEKERS FELT REMOVED FROM THEIR OWN JOB-SEARCHING PROCESS.</h4>
              <p>During our inquiries with TCW navigators, we found out that jobseekers only get to meet with their navigators once every 2 weeks. Between each session, jobseekers had no way of accessing the data—about their own job-searching progress—that navigators were seeing. To make matters worse, they lacked easy communication with their navigators, leading to an uninteractive and isolating experience.</p>

          <h2>Process</h2>
            <div class="subcontainer">
              <h3>User Flow</h3>
              <p class="subsubcontainer">My team began by mapping out a simple user flow based on the three types of TCW users: administrators, navigators, and jobseekers (my main population of interest for this project). This grounded us with a home base from which we could ideate possible solutions from the perspectives of all kinds of TCW members.</p>

              <img src="user-flow.png" class="subsubcontainer diagram">

            <div class="subcontainer">
              <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>
              <div class="subsubcontainer">
                <p>My team—in collaboration with the lovely folks over at TCW who acted as our liasions—decided to represent jobseeker milestones in the form of a pirate roadmap! This was inspired by Our Flag Means Death, an HBO rom-com about gay pirates that had just released.</p>
                <p>From this point on, I assumed full ownership over this portion of the project. I began by creating a (very) rudimentary sketch, incorporating my idea to make a fun, alliterative name for each island!</p>
              </div>
              <img src="initial-sketches.png" class="subsubcontainer diagram">
            </div>

            <div class="subcontainer">
              <h3>Iterations</h3>
              <p class="subsubcontainer">After making my low-fidelity sketches, one of the first things to do was to replace the blobs with actual islands! Each of the 10 islands represented a section of the spreadsheet that TCW used to use to manage jobseekers. Since this would be a client-facing interface, my main goal here was to create a unique visual theme and name for each one.</p>
              <img src="iteration1.png" class="subsubcontainer diagram">

              <p class="subsubcontainer">Fast forward several more iterations (I wish I could show you the whole process!)… the next major update came after recieving some preliminary feedback from TCW. I rearranged the islands into a more intuitive order, and adjusted the roadmap details popup to align with TCW’s style guide. In addition, I made some more stylistic adjustments to add visual interest!</p>
              <img src="iteration2.png" class="subsubcontainer diagram">
            </div>

            <div class="subcontainer">
              <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
              <p class="subsubcontainer">At this point, the app was ready for testing with some real users. My team recruited 3 participants—a mix of jobseekers and navigators—to try out the new roadmap. We received some valuable feedback in the process!</p>

              <div class="subsubcontainer">
                <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-map-location-dot"></i>Remove repetitive elements.</h4>
                <p>The Menu button on the topleft, which served solely as an alternative way of navigating the islands, was only complicating things without providing any additional accessibility. After some discussion, my team and I opted to replace it with a link to an external calendar of TCW events, for easy jobseeker access.</p>

                <p>Even in our relatively small testing pool, we saw participants joining the call from tablets and mobile phones. Certain parts of our prototype weren’t equipped to handle these touch interactions, which only emphasized that we couldn’t bank on every user accessing TCW through a computer (an assumption we'd previously made).</p>

To help guide jobseekers along their journey, the dotted line to the red X (in keeping with the pirate theme) provides a sense of direction. Islands will also start black-and-white, then fill in with color once their corresponding milestone is completed, so that progress feels more rewarding and interactive.</p>

              <p>When I was first breaking into design, I never thought I’d one day be creating a pirate map for job-hunting. This project, with all its flashy colors and illustrations, was much different from the minimalistic designs I was used to. </p>
              <p>However, doing something a bit outside of my design comfort zone was incredibly refreshing and eye-opening. I got to create a gamified client interface—a rare opportunity—and I was also introduced a whole world of maximalist design trends and styles that I had yet to previously delve into. I cannot wait to see what else is out their in the world of design!</p>

              <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-shapes"></i>Keep an Organized Design File.</h4>
              <p>This project helped me realize that in many ways, design is more about working smart than working hard (although I'd like to think I am doing both!) This can mean maintaining organized design files that make full use of components. Componentizing everything from input fields to  decorational shipwrecks ended up saving me hours of time, allowing for a more quality end result. </p>
              <p>My only regret is that I wish I’d started sooner—I only bit the bullet and componentized all of my work around the third iteration—but now I know better for whatever project I take on next!</p>

            <p class="shoutout">... And a big thank you to the TransCanWork team for holding the most wonderfully chaotic work sessions, for implementing all the crazy designs I came up with without a complaint, and for always being up for a discussion about whether Helen Keller really flew a plane.</p>
